## PAYUNGI Environment Installation Guide
### Android Studio Set-up

After you download Android Studio, the first thing Android studio gonna ask is whether user want to make new project or open an existing project.

Choose **open an existing project**, then made sure you choose the PAYUNGI-master clone/download

![Example](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yGJFDJxnhnZvF2seEBcdEwgrDcXmqDSh)

after android studio open the project, it will automatically download all the library it need, starting from Gradle library and then other implemented libraries in the project.

This action will take about 10 - 30 minutes to download all the library, wait until it's done.
After it's done you can now see the android studio has already indexed the file so it's more easy to read

If you have achieve until this step then you're ready to develop your code to PAYUNGI project.


### Firebase Set-up
After You change the code and messing with it's backend, You definitely want to test it out but before you could test the code in either your own phone or Android Virtual Device(AVD). You need to connect your firebase account to the project. It could be done by checking the Firebase assistant in tools tab.
